Project Selected from GitHub 
Google Compute Engine Cluster for Hadoop
I am surprised to see GitHub platform. Lots of repositories, with code, commits, issues, wikis. I think almost all the solutions of NP problems are here. There are hundreds of current and existing projects on this platform. I have selected Google Compute Engine Cluster for Hadoop. The application sets up Google Compute Engine instances as a Hadoop cluster and executes MapReduce tasks. The purpose of the application is to demonstrate how to leverage Google Compute Engine for parallel processing with MapReduce on Hadoop. The application takes advantage of MapReduce tasks to parallelize the copy of input and output of MapReduce between Google Cloud Storage and HDFS.
